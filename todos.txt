TODO:

finish the model pipeline
train model on full dataset and report results
apply different registration methods
    -> background removal
    -> bbox arround the abdomen region
    -> resize
    -> apply previous registration methods
    -> Diffeomorphic methods
    -> voxelmorph
    -> apply tsne to check the clusters in the model
    -> apply multi atlas registration
    
done check the model pipeline ---> dimensions of input/output is not ok

---------------------
done fix model dimentions-> output volume doesnt match the input volume
done check btcv sample meta data
resolved check the registration method for average volumes messy output
